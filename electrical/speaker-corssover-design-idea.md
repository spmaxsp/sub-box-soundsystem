## Driver Selection

No real selection, just what I had laying around.

### DX164 25mm Dome Tweeter:
Power Handling: 	25 Watt RMS
Impedance: 	        8 Ohm
Frequency Response: 1000 Hz - 20 kHz

### Unknown Mid-Range-driver:
Power Handling: 	125 Watt RMS
Impedance: 	        8 Ohm
Frequency Response: 100 Hz - 15 kHz

### Unknown Low-Range-driver:
Power Handling: 	75 Watt RMS
Impedance: 	        4 Ohm
Frequency Response: 50 Hz - ??? Hz

## Crossover Design

The crossover frequencies where mainly chosen by the power handling of the drivers, but also by the frequency response of the drivers.
For rough power distribution, I divide the frequency range in octaves.
Because the Mid-Range-driver has a wide frequency response and can handle a lot of power, i tried to give it the most octaves, while the high-range-driver only gets one octave.

1st octave: 100 Hz - 200 Hz
2nd octave: 200 Hz - 400 Hz
3rd octave: 400 Hz - 800 Hz
4th octave: 800 Hz - 1,600 Hz
5th octave: 1,600 Hz - 3,200 Hz
6th octave: 3,200 Hz - 6,400 Hz
7th octave: 6,400 Hz - 12,800 Hz
8th octave: 12,800 Hz - 25,600 Hz

High-Range: 12,800 Hz - 25,600 Hz  (1 octave)
-->  1/8 the power  --> 200w/8 = 25w

Mid-Range: 400 Hz - 12,800 Hz  (5 octaves)
-->  5/8 the power  --> 200w/8*5 = 125w

Low-Range: 50 Hz - 400 Hz  (3 octaves)
-->  3/8 the power  --> 200w/8*3 = 75w

This corresponds well with the power handling of the drivers and the frequency response of the drivers.
so the crossover frequencies are:

#### High-Range: 12,800 Hz
#### Mid-Range: 400 Hz
